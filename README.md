# Tableau Project
## Background
Dognition (http://www.dognition.com) is a company that teaches you how to build a deeper connection with your dog by giving you an unprecedented perspective on your dog’s personality and capabilities. The main purpose of this project is helping them figure out what business changes they could implement to increase the number of tests users complete on their website.

Dognition has provided a dataset for analysis in order to develop your recommendations. You need to read the dataset description and understand this dataset to gain insight into customer’s behavior through the analysis process. 

Our job now is to present the findings to the management team about what they could do to increase the number of tests users complete. You will make this recommendation based on what you learned through analyzing the data.  
## Outcome
A complete script of your presentation in the text box (500-700 words), PLUS a corresponding Tableau Story (2-5 visuals).
