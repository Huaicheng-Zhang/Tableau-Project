# Description

**Some information about the dataset:**  
• The 20-game Dognition Assessment assesses 5 core dimensions of cognition:
empathy, communication, cunning, memory, and reasoning.  
• With a few exceptions, all games are presented to customers in the same order.
Customers are not able to advance through tasks or trials out of order. This rule is
implemented to make it as easy as possible for participants to follow all the steps of
the games correctly.  
• After completing the 20-game Dognition Assessment, customers can sign up to
receive additional games and activities at the rate of one game and one activity per
month.  
• The Dognition team ran an experiment to determine whether a promotion that gave
customers free access to the first 4 games of the Dognition Assessment would entice
them to pay to complete the rest of the Dognition Assessment.
